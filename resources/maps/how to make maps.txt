MOVING PLATFORMS:
---------------------------------

Moving platforms must be an object created on the object layer called "collisions". Select the layer, then select the insert polygon tool, or press the P key. Use this tool to create your shape,
making sure that the finished shape is a closed loop. For now, moving platforms will only be rendered to the size of 1 tile, so make sure to keep your polygon around the size of the tile you are using.
Polygons should also be kept to 8 points or less (for now). Once you have created the shape, make sure it is selected and open up its properties menu (right click if it isn't there already).
In the "type" field of the properties, type in "mp" to set it to a moving platform.
